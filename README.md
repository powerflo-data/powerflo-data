- 👋 Hi, I’m Oliver :)
- 👀 I’m interested in Engineering and Data Science.
- 🌱 Since I mastered the Data Analytics Bootcamp @Ironhack, I’m currently studying more about Data Science and dive deeper into it:
-   * ML-Libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn etc.)
-   * A/B-Testing
-   * NLP
-   * Optimization of modeling performance
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on time analysis projects in future.
